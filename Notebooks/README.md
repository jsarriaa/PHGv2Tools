Notebooks are free to use and edit.
There are actually identical to the equivalent module at [scripts folder](https://github.com/jsarriaa/PHGv2Tools/tree/main/Modules) but it is coded to work different just if the file is ending in .py or .ipynb.

When defining the main function, note the block of code where input variables are defined. When working in a notebook declare there whatever you need. Whole script will run with them.
